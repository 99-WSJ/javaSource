/**
 * The PostConstruct annotation is used on a method that needs to be executed
 * after dependency injection is done to perform any initialization. This
 * method MUST be invoked before the class is put into service. This
 * annotation MUST be supported on all classes that support dependency
 * injection. The method annotated with PostConstruct MUST be invoked even
 * if the class does not request any resources to be injected. Only one
 * method can be annotated with this annotation. The method on which the
 * PostConstruct annotation is applied MUST fulfill all of the following
 * criteria:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The method MUST NOT have any parameters except in the case of
 * interceptors in which case it takes an InvocationContext object as
 * defined by the Interceptors specification.</li>
 * <li>The method defined on an interceptor class MUST HAVE one of the
 * following signatures:
 * <p>
 * void &#060;METHOD&#062;(InvocationContext)
 * <p>
 * Object &#060;METHOD&#062;(InvocationContext) throws Exception
 * <p>
 * <i>Note: A PostConstruct interceptor method must not throw application
 * exceptions, but it may be declared to throw checked exceptions including
 * the java.lang.Exception if the same interceptor method interposes on
 * business or timeout methods in addition to lifecycle events. If a
 * PostConstruct interceptor method returns a value, it is ignored by
 * the container.</i>
 * </li>
 * <li>The method defined on a non-interceptor class MUST HAVE the
 * following signature:
 * <p>
 * void &#060;METHOD&#062;()
 * </li>
 * <li>The method on which PostConstruct is applied MAY be public, protected,
 * package private or private.</li>
 * <li>The method MUST NOT be static except for the application client.</li>
 * <li>The method MAY be final.</li>
 * <li>If the method throws an unchecked exception the class MUST NOT be put into
 * service except in the case of EJBs where the EJB can handle exceptions and
 * even recover from them.</li></ul>

/**
 * <p>Interface implemented by an MBean that emits Notifications. It
 * allows a listener to be registered with the MBean as a notification
 * listener.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Notification dispatch</h3>
 *
 * <p>When an MBean emits a notification, it considers each listener that has been
 * added with {@link #addNotificationListener addNotificationListener} and not
 * subsequently removed with {@link #removeNotificationListener removeNotificationListener}.
 * If a filter was provided with that listener, and if the filter's
 * {@link NotificationFilter#isNotificationEnabled isNotificationEnabled} method returns
 * false, the listener is ignored.  Otherwise, the listener's
 * {@link NotificationListener#handleNotification handleNotification} method is called with
 * the notification, as well as the handback object that was provided to
 * {@code addNotificationListener}.</p>
 *
 * <p>If the same listener is added more than once, it is considered as many times as it was
 * added.  It is often useful to add the same listener with different filters or handback
 * objects.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface can differ regarding the thread in which the methods
 * of filters and listeners are called.</p>
 *
 * <p>If the method call of a filter or listener throws an {@link Exception}, then that
 * exception should not prevent other listeners from being invoked.  However, if the method
 * call throws an {@link Error}, then it is recommended that processing of the notification
 * stop at that point, and if it is possible to propagate the {@code Error} to the sender of
 * the notification, this should be done.</p>
 *
 * <p>New code should use the {@link NotificationEmitter} interface
 * instead.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface and of {@code NotificationEmitter}
 * should be careful about synchronization.  In particular, it is not a good
 * idea for an implementation to hold any locks while it is calling a
 * listener.  To deal with the possibility that the list of listeners might
 * change while a notification is being dispatched, a good strategy is to
 * use a {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList} for this list.

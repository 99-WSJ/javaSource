/**
 * A skeletal visitor of types with default behavior appropriate for
 * the {@link javax.lang.model.SourceVersion#RELEASE_8 RELEASE_8}
 * source version.
 *
 * <p> <b>WARNING:</b> The {@code TypeVisitor} interface implemented
 * by this class may have methods added to it in the future to
 * accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures added to
 * future versions of the Java&trade; programming language.
 * Therefore, methods whose names begin with {@code "visit"} may be
 * added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities,
 * classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
 * methods with names beginning with {@code "visit"}.
 *
 * <p>When such a new visit method is added, the default
 * implementation in this class will be to call the {@link
 * #visitUnknown visitUnknown} method.  A new abstract type visitor
 * class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language
 * level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the
 * visit method in question.  When the new visitor is introduced, all
 * or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
 *
 * <p>Note that adding a default implementation of a new visit method
 * in a visitor class will occur instead of adding a <em>default
 * method</em> directly in the visitor interface since a Java SE 8
 * language feature cannot be used to this version of the API since
 * this version is required to be runnable on Java SE 7
 * implementations.  Future versions of the API that are only required
 * to run on Java SE 8 and later may take advantage of default methods
 * in this situation.
 *
 * @param <R> the return type of this visitor's methods.  Use {@link
 *            Void} for visitors that do not need to return results.
 * @param <P> the type of the additional parameter to this visitor's
 *            methods.  Use {@code Void} for visitors that do not need an
 *            additional parameter.
 *
 * @see AbstractTypeVisitor6
 * @see AbstractTypeVisitor7
 * @since 1.8

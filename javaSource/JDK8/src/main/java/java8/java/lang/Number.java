/**
 * The abstract class {@code Number} is the superclass of platform
 * classes representing numeric values that are convertible to the
 * primitive types {@code byte}, {@code double}, {@code float}, {@code
 * int}, {@code long}, and {@code short}.
 *
 * The specific semantics of the conversion from the numeric value of
 * a particular {@code Number} implementation to a given primitive
 * type is defined by the {@code Number} implementation in question.
 *
 * For platform classes, the conversion is often analogous to a
 * narrowing primitive conversion or a widening primitive conversion
 * as defining in <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite>
 * for converting between primitive types.  Therefore, conversions may
 * lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value, may
 * lose precision, and may even return a result of a different sign
 * than the input.
 *
 * See the documentation of a given {@code Number} implementation for
 * conversion details.

 * Multilingual Plane (BMP)</i> or a surrogate. Refer to <a

 * <p> This interface does not refine the general contracts of the {@link

 * Object#hashCode() hashCode} methods.  The result of comparing two
 * objects that implement <tt>CharSequence</tt> is therefore, in general,

 * for equality with those of the other.  It is therefore inappropriate to use
 * arbitrary <tt>CharSequence</tt> instances as elements in a set or as keys in

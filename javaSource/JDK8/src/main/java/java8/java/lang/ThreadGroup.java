/* The locking strategy for this code is to try to lock only one level of the

 * That is, from child thread groups to parents.
 * This has the advantage of limiting the number of locks that need to be held
 * and in particular avoids having to grab the lock for the root thread group,
 * (or a global lock) which would be a source of contention on a
 * multi-processor system with many thread groups.
 * This policy often leads to taking a snapshot of the state of a thread group
 * and working off of that snapshot, rather than holding the thread group locked
 * while we work on the children.

/**
 * A selectable channel for stream-oriented listening sockets.
 *
 * <p> A server-socket channel is created by invoking the {@link #open() open}
 * method of this class.  It is not possible to create a channel for an arbitrary,
 * pre-existing {@link ServerSocket}. A newly-created server-socket channel is
 * open but not yet bound.  An attempt to invoke the {@link #accept() accept}
 * method of an unbound server-socket channel will cause a {@link NotYetBoundException}
 * to be thrown. A server-socket channel can be bound by invoking one of the
 * {@link #bind(SocketAddress,int) bind} methods defined by this class.
 *
 * <p> Socket options are configured using the {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object)
 * setOption} method. Server-socket channels support the following options:
 * <blockquote>
 * <table border summary="Socket options">
 *   <tr>
 *     <th>Option Name</th>
 *     <th>Description</th>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} </td>
 *     <td> The size of the socket receive buffer </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} </td>
 *     <td> Re-use address </td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>
 * </blockquote>
 * Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.
 *
 * <p> Server-socket channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.

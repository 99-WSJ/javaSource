/**
 * The {@code DataInput} interface provides
 * for reading bytes from a binary stream and
 * reconstructing from them data in any of
 * the Java primitive types. There is also
 * a
 * facility for reconstructing a {@code String}
 * from data in
 * <a href="#modified-utf-8">modified UTF-8</a>
 * format.
 * <p>
 * It is generally true of all the reading
 * routines in this interface that if end of
 * file is reached before the desired number
 * of bytes has been read, an {@code EOFException}
 * (which is a kind of {@code IOException})
 * is thrown. If any byte cannot be read for
 * any reason other than end of file, an {@code IOException}
 * other than {@code EOFException} is
 * thrown. In particular, an {@code IOException}
 * may be thrown if the input stream has been
 * closed.
 *
 * <h3><a name="modified-utf-8">Modified UTF-8</a></h3>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of the DataInput and DataOutput interfaces represent
 * Unicode strings in a format that is a slight modification of UTF-8.
 * (For information regarding the standard UTF-8 format, see section
 * <i>3.9 Unicode Encoding Forms</i> of <i>The Unicode Standard, Version
 * 4.0</i>).
 * Note that in the following table, the most significant bit appears in the
 * far left-hand column.

 * <ul>
 * <li>The null byte {@code '\u005Cu0000'} is encoded in 2-byte format
 *     rather than 1-byte, so that the encoded strings never have
 *     embedded nulls.
 * <li>Only the 1-byte, 2-byte, and 3-byte formats are used.
 * <li><a href="../lang/Character.html#unicode">Supplementary characters</a>
 *     are represented in the form of surrogate pairs.

/**
 * Class {@code URL} represents a Uniform Resource
 * Locator, a pointer to a "resource" on the World
 * Wide Web. A resource can be something as simple as a file or a
 * directory, or it can be a reference to a more complicated object,
 * such as a query to a database or to a search engine. More
 * information on the types of URLs and their formats can be found at:
 * <a href=
 * "http://web.archive.org/web/20051219043731/http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Demo/url-primer.html">
 * <i>Types of URL</i></a>
 * <p>
 * In general, a URL can be broken into several parts. Consider the
 * following example:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     http://www.example.com/docs/resource1.html
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * The URL above indicates that the protocol to use is
 * {@code http} (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and that the
 * information resides on a host machine named
 * {@code www.example.com}. The information on that host
 * machine is named {@code /docs/resource1.html}. The exact
 * meaning of this name on the host machine is both protocol
 * dependent and host dependent. The information normally resides in
 * a file, but it could be generated on the fly. This component of
 * the URL is called the <i>path</i> component.
 * <p>
 * A URL can optionally specify a "port", which is the
 * port number to which the TCP connection is made on the remote host
 * machine. If the port is not specified, the default port for
 * the protocol is used instead. For example, the default port for
 * {@code http} is {@code 80}. An alternative port could be
 * specified as:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     http://www.example.com:1080/docs/resource1.html
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * The syntax of {@code URL} is defined by  <a
 * href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2396: Uniform
 * Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax</i></a>, amended by <a
 * href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2732: Format for
 * Literal IPv6 Addresses in URLs</i></a>. The Literal IPv6 address format
 * also supports scope_ids. The syntax and usage of scope_ids is described
 * <a href="Inet6Address.html#scoped">here</a>.
 * <p>
 * A URL may have appended to it a "fragment", also known
 * as a "ref" or a "reference". The fragment is indicated by the sharp
 * sign character "#" followed by more characters. For example,
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     http://java.sun.com/index.html#chapter1
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * This fragment is not technically part of the URL. Rather, it
 * indicates that after the specified resource is retrieved, the
 * application is specifically interested in that part of the
 * document that has the tag {@code chapter1} attached to it. The
 * meaning of a tag is resource specific.
 * <p>
 * An application can also specify a "relative URL",
 * which contains only enough information to reach the resource
 * relative to another URL. Relative URLs are frequently used within
 * HTML pages. For example, if the contents of the URL:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     http://java.sun.com/index.html
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * contained within it the relative URL:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     FAQ.html
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * it would be a shorthand for:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     http://java.sun.com/FAQ.html
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * The relative URL need not specify all the components of a URL. If
 * the protocol, host name, or port number is missing, the value is
 * inherited from the fully specified URL. The file component must be
 * specified. The optional fragment is not inherited.
 * <p>
 * The URL class does not itself encode or decode any URL components
 * according to the escaping mechanism defined in RFC2396. It is the
 * responsibility of the caller to encode any fields, which need to be
 * escaped prior to calling URL, and also to decode any escaped fields,
 * that are returned from URL. Furthermore, because URL has no knowledge
 * of URL escaping, it does not recognise equivalence between the encoded
 * or decoded form of the same URL. For example, the two URLs:<br>
 * <pre>    http://foo.com/hello world/ and http://foo.com/hello%20world</pre>
 * would be considered not equal to each other.
 * <p>
 * Note, the {@link URI} class does perform escaping of its
 * component fields in certain circumstances. The recommended way
 * to manage the encoding and decoding of URLs is to use {@link URI},
 * and to convert between these two classes using {@link #toURI()} and
 * {@link URI#toURL()}.
 * <p>
 * The {@link URLEncoder} and {@link URLDecoder} classes can also be
 * used, but only for HTML form encoding, which is not the same
 * as the encoding scheme defined in RFC2396.

     *     If the value of that system property is not {@code null},

     *         &lt;<i>package</i>&gt;.&lt;<i>protocol</i>&gt;.Handler

     *     a subclass of {@code URLStreamHandler}, then the next package
     *     in the list is tried.
     * <li>If the previous step fails to find a protocol handler, then the

     *     <blockquote><pre>
     *         &lt;<i>system default package</i>&gt;.&lt;<i>protocol</i>&gt;.Handler
